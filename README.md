# **WIP** | The Ultimate FBW-WD-D07 Student-Name-Generator 3000&trade; &copy;! | **WIP**

Just a fun little project made with the intention that our teachers can randomly generate the name of a student of our class 'FBW-WD-D07', to make it easier to choose who should present the current assignment or answer a question.

## How it works

You press the Button 'It's Generate-Time!' and you'll see a totally random Name from the list of student names of the class. It's random, so it can happen that a name shows up a couple of times.

I also added a reset button called 'I want a clean slate' which simply reloads the page to get rid of the name

And that's it!

### Credit where credit's due:

At this point in time we haven't had Javascript lessons yet, so I searched for a solution that doesn't involve Javascript and just uses HTML and CSS.
Unless my Google-Fu is too rusty, I couldn't find such a solution.
So I watched [Alanna Risse's YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1VX7n9xAeI) on exactly that: How to make a random Message Generator.
So thank you, [Alanna](https://github.com/alannarisse), for the fun video that not only helped me make this project but also understand what I was doing!
